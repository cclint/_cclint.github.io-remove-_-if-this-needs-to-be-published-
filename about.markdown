### About me
I'm a tinkerer and I have a passion for exploring and automation. I'm a rising senior at the University of Alabama at Birmingham studying Computer Science and Mathematics. After studying mathematics for a few years, I eventually found and fell in love with software development. Since the spark of this new-found passion, I have found interests in computer graphics, game engines, web and mobile app development, and programming languages. When I'm not programming, I love to spend time with family, reading, playing guitar, bike riding, and attending car shows.

### The purpose of this site
This blog is where I'll write on various topics, including but not limited to: software development, disney tech, gardening, and anything else that interests me!
