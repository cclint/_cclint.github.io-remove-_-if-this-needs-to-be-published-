### About me
My name is Clinton Campbell. I'm a senior at the University of Alabama at Birmingham studying Computer Science and Mathematics. I spend a good bit of my spare time as a software developer intern at UAB's Research Computing department, where I'm currently building a script to measure transfer speeds for different reference data sets, using the Globus API, python and matplotlib. I've been programming for about two years, and I've found interests in computer graphics and the math behind it, game engines, web and mobile app development, and programming languages. When I'm not programming, I love to spend time reading philosophy books, playing guitar, bike riding, and attending car shows. 

### The purpose of this site
This blog is where I'll write on various topics including but not limited to; software development, disney tech, gardening, and anything else that interests me!
