### About me
My name is Clinton Campbell and I'm a rising senior at the University of Alabama at Birmingham studying Computer Science and Mathematics. Before college, I was a mechanic at Lacey’s Paint and Body in a small town in Alabama. As my passion for math and science matured, I finally decided to give college a shot. Three years later, I have found new interests in Computer Science; in particular computer graphics, game engines, automation testing, and web and mobile app development. I love to automate (checkout my iEat project) and innovate. I offer a unique combination of skill sets that set me apart from others in my field. Currently, I am a Software Developer Intern at the University of Alabama at Birmingham’s Research Computing Department. When I'm not programming, I love to spend time with family, playing guitar, bike riding, attending car shows, and star gazing. 

### The purpose of this site
This blog is where I'll write on various topics including but not limited to; software development, disney tech, gardening, and anything else that interests me!
