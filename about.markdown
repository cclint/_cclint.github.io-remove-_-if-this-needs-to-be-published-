### About me
Whew, a lot has happened since my last post! If you're not familiar, my name is Clint Campbell. Just a few months ago, I finished my degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics. 
During finals of my last semester, I packed up all of my belongings in my Tacoma (plus Java, my Golden Retriever) and moved to Vancouver, Washington to take up mountaineering and 
other outdoor hobbies! When I'm not taking Java to the dog park or working, I'm typically out in the mountains. 


### The purpose of this site
This blog is where I'll write on various topics, including but not limited to: software development, cycling, gardening, and anything else that interests me!
