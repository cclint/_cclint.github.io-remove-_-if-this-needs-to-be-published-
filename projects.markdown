## My First Ray Tracer!
During my second semester as a computer science student at UAB, I became acquainted with my objected oriented programming professor, Dr. Byrd. One weekend (right before finals..), I called him asking if he would be interested in coding up a ray tracer with me. That same Satruday afternoon.. 9 hours later.. we built a [my first raytracer](https://github.com/cclint/first-raytracer) in Racket!
